            Le Corbusier's Fondation Suisse, Paris France
          </h1>
            <p>
              Fondation Suisse was built between 1931-1933 and is one of 37 other buildings in the area of Cite Internationale Universitaire in Paris which all were built between 1925-1969. It is like a international exhibition where several different countries are represented within different styles of architecture. Five thousands people lives here and 130 different nationalities are represented in the area.
            </p>
            <h3>Program</h3>
            <p>
              Fondation Suisse cater 46 student rooms which have a surface of 16 square meters each. Even tough the spaces are very small they all have a shower and a sink. The spaces are also well-planned, for example a refrigerator is built-in in the tables. Some of the other furnitures have been designed by Charlotte Perriand. The rooms are silent even tough the walls seams to be surprisingly thin. This because of the interior walls are not stuck to the main structure and a lead plate have been placed behind so that the sound bundle up and not bounce further.
            </p>
            <p>
              The building is four floors high, but from the beginning the idea was to build five floors. On the three top floors  all the student rooms are distributed and each of these floors also contain a little kitchen and two toilettes. The bottom floor is a place for the students to meet and relax. On the fourth, and top floor, there is also a library and computer rooms.
            </p>
            <h3>Construction principals</h3>
            <p>
              Fondation Suisse is built upon double rows of columns which are four meters high and dug deep down in the ground. These columns work as carrying for the structure of the main building and they are one of the points in Le Corbusier’s five points for a new architecture. Another of his points which also can be seen in the building  are long horizontal windows, free-designed facade and roof garden. The overall style of the building is early functionalism. All the roofs in the rooms are painted in different colors like green, yellow, red and blue. On a dark evening it looks like a huge work of art. Later on, Pavillon Suisse have also been a source of inspiration for Le Corbusier’s Unites d’habitation in Marseilles.
