        <h2>
          Umeå School of Architecture<br>
          4th semester/spring 2013<br>
          Food market project
        </h2>
          <h1>
            Umeås saluhall<br>
            (food market)
          </h1>
            <h3>Concept</h3>
              <p>
                We were tasked with creating a food market for the citizens of Umeå. A key element was to create an architectural complex that unites central Umeå with Umeålven.
              </p>
            <h3>Exterior</h3>
              <p>
               The roof is not only a roof; it also creates a large staircase and a bridge which function as a shortcut from central Umeå through the nearby parks over Östra strandgatan down to the river. The space created by the staircase also provide areas where an outdoor market can take place, a terrace for the café and a place where people can sit, lay down, hang out and enjoy the beautiful river of Umeå.
              </p>
            <h3>Placement</h3>
              <p>
               The food market’s placement below Döbelns park uses the difference in height to not disturb the vista from the park and to interact with the exterior without interfering with the cultural buildings in the area.
              </p>
            <h3>Program</h3>
              <p>
                The interior creates different spaces for selling food through permanent shops and temporary areas with stalls. You could have a fika in the café, eat food or have a drink in the restaurant and the bar. Outside there is space for an outdoor market where stalls could be placed on the roof and towards the boardwalk. You could also sell directly from a lorry, car or even from your boat.
              </p>
            <h3>Relation to the surrounding</h3>
              <p>
                From the north, Döbelns park, the building is almost hidden, the only thing seen is the gradually expanding roof.
                The entrance is integrated 2,4 meters down in the park. The transition is solved by stairs heading down in the park leading towards one of the three entrances and to the outdoor passage, where the shortcut to come down to the river is found.
                From the west to the east, along the shoreline, it is a part of the boardwalk. It turns this area, which today is basically just a parking lot, to a well-visited place.
              </p>
