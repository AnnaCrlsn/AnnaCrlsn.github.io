            <h3>Project description</h3>
              <p>
                My project is based on mapping from several groups in the previous urban analysis of Sundsvall. Briefly, it first deals with how to create a new infrastructural urbanism around the bay that can be developed due to the new bridge. One focus has been to make it more pedestrian and bicycle friendly by reworking the massive and heavy E4 into a calm urban street.
              </p>
              <p>
                The old industries didn't just leave voids after them but also lots of contaminated soil and water. This dark fact is an example of knowledge that we learned through research. Today there are different kinds of research units spread around Sundsvall. At the university for instance there is a section called FSCN, fiber science and communication network, which are researching on cellulose fiber technology. Many businesses also operate researches within their company, for example SCA. Secondly, the project is going to focus on sustainable research specialized in natural science. It could investigate, prevent and solve problems of contamination as mentioned before. The old forest industry weren't sustainable at all with for instance the impregnation of the wood. Another, of many other research fields, could for instance be about new ways to work even more sustainable with wood. The opportunities are endless.
              </p>
              <p>
                The business seems to be going well but still the unemployment is rather high. At the university there is a small incubator company called Åkroken business incubator. The organization helps people to start companies by offering contacts, cheap venues and expertise. The work is based on the triple helix model, i.e. an interaction between academia, industry and public stakeholders. The incubators are placed in the outskirts of the city center. Today 90 companies are connected and it’s expanding to include the whole region. Thirdly, my project is going to use this concept but placing it in the center of Sundsvall where most of the companies are and also let it be much more visible to the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                In conclusion, the concept of the project is to create a new hub for research, conference and incubators, specialized in natural science and a special green house section, to be able to collaborate and share ideas. Integrating it with the urban spaces around the water, the quay, the boardwalk, the connections to the surrounding areas and the new infrastructural system the project will create a new connection to the bay and the waterfront. The central placement should open up opportunities to collaborate even more with other businesses and make it visually and physically connected to the public. Besides the spaces aimed for the people working there the hybrid building has a public restaurant serving lunch and dinner and in between the meals work as a café. The restaurant will grow their own crops in the green house as well as have a winter garden where the dinner guests can enjoy the feeling of summer all year round. To inform and enlighten the public what is going on there should also be spaces where the work could be exhibited and where workshops, lectures and conferences can be held. - <em>How do you create this symbiosis between a calm and inspiring work environment that as the same time should be visually displayed, reach the public and create physical meetings?</em>
              </p>
            <h3>Urban strategy</h3>
              <p>
                During the urban strategy phase my group worked with the concept of creating hybrid bridges connecting the south and north part of Sundsvall with the bay. The strategy was called <q>Sundsvall, a city rediscovering its waterfront - Bridging the gap</q>. In this project I propose to use the same principle but connecting the central parts of Sundsvall with the inner harbor. The inner harbor could be seen as the most developed part but there are still some empty plots creating gaps. The chosen site is today pretty much just an asphalt stripe of parking just in the northeast part of the inner harbor. The only thing connecting the people of Sundsvall here to the bay is Medvind, a restaurant boat which is quite popular during the summers. The aim is to create a new axis from Navet, the bus station, through Sjögatan, passing Kulturmagasinet, the culture center where the city library and archive are, all the way down to the waterfront.
              </p>
