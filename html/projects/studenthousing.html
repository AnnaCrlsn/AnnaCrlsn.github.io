            <h3>Program</h3>
              <p>
                The assignment for this project was to redevelop and extend an already existing building of about 80 m<sup>2</sup> in order to make space for a group of six students. The concept was to create a vertical connection between the students renting from the family.

            <h3 class="margin-top-text">The exterior</h3>
              <p>
                The concept of the exterior is that the angle of the stairs is reflected in the construction and all the way out to the facade. The columns and beams are made up by laminated wood. The idea behind using the angle of the stair is on one hand when you look straight towards the building, in the facade, hide the steps so that it looks like the ones walking are kind of floating. And on the other hand to break up the strict and classical facades which are in the area right now.

              <p>
                The bedroom-units are located to the north. There are basically two kinds of units where the students can sleep, store and study, the difference is the ceiling height and each of the six are furnished differently. The units have a small living space, of about four square meters where they can fit a desk and wardrobes. The wardrobes are built like a staircase going up to a sleeping loft. The lofts save living space from the square meters we were allowed to build. They are arranged so that they either are placed above a corridor or are overlapped with another loft, like <q>tetris L’s</q>.

              <p>
                The ground floor part 1 (see ground floor) is exactly as it was from the beginning. Part 2 has been redeveloped to fit the new program. Here is a common entrance, spaces for storage, garage, bicycle parking, washroom and a bathroom with a sauna. These spaces are mainly aimed for the family living there but could be shared between the students.
              </p>
              <p>
                The extended part is divided into five half floors. When moving up from the ground floor to the first floor you enter a living room. There are also two bathrooms and two bedroom-units. When you move up one half floor more a kitchen and dining room are located and also one more bedroom-unit. The balcony can be accessed both from the living room and the kitchen. Going up a half floor, to floor two, there are a small space for reading and gathering, two more bedroom-units and another six steps up are the last bedroom-unit. Finally, on the top floor, the stairs end in a roof terrace.
